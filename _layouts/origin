<h1>What?</h1>
<p>Jerakia is a data lookup tool inspired by Hiera, the lookup system integegrated into Puppet.  It can function as a drop-in replacement for Hiera, or work along side it, as well as integrate with other tools in your automation stack.  Jerakia supports multiple pluggable datasources to allow you to look up data in a hierarchcal fashion from any number of sources.</p>

<h1>Why?</h1>
<p>Jerakia aims to deliver a high degree of flexibility around data lookup management.  It was initially developed to meet the needs of Hiera users with edge cases that arise when managing complex infrastructures that go beyond the single-customer, small scale implementation and become more diverse and complex.  Data lookup management has become a crucial part of any automation toolchain and where you store and how you query the data that drives your infrastructure has become an increasingly challenging concept.  Jerakia not only aims to provide a flexible way to manage your data but also integrate with a wide variety of tools.  Currently most of the focus has been around Puppet, but with the new API features in 1.2 we are aiming to give users a data lookup platform that can be shared with all the tools they implement, from configuration management to orchestration and CI pipelines.
